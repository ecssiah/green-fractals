In the late 90s, a computer scientist named Melinda Green discovered a fascinating new way of looking at the Mandlebrot set.

Melindaâ€™s technique samples points in the complex plane, and then repeatedly applies the Mandelbrot equation to these points to see if they eventually land outside of an escape radius after a certain number of iterations.
