TODO:
1. Logging process
2. Optimize by removing main sections of mandelbrot
3. Perform gradient descent on params to find interesting features
4. Do ML to find best places to pick seed points
5. Animate the gradient descent process, produce a frame at each descent step
6. It's possible to fluctuate the parameters in sync with an audio signal to match the animation to music (or any interesting signal)

Optimizations:
1. Cardioid and bulb detection
2. Boundary detection
3. Brent's Algorithm for cycle detection
